# entropy-and-persistent-homology
To begin with, I am interested in ways to think about diversity and geography.  One example might be variants of Covid-19, another might be trees ([https://senseable.mit.edu/papers/pdf/20210325_Galle-etal_MappingDiversity_UFUG.pdf](https://senseable.mit.edu/papers/pdf/20210325_Galle-etal_MappingDiversity_UFUG.pdf)).  I would like to see if wildlife data, as in  [https://www.inaturalist.org/](https://www.inaturalist.org/), can support the same type of analysis.  Compared to trees, wildlife is perhaps a bit more interesting since some wildlife is carnivorous.  I am interested in combining/comparing (in a way I haven't yet figured out) entropy (see the above paper) and persistent homology (see [https://projecteuclid.org/journals/algebraic-and-geometric-topology/volume-7/issue-1/Coverage-in-sensor-networks-via-persistent-homology/10.2140/agt.2007.7.339.full](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/algebraic-and-geometric-topology/volume-7/issue-1/Coverage-in-sensor-networks-via-persistent-homology/10.2140/agt.2007.7.339.full)).  See also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nUBqawu41k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nUBqawu41k). Task:  can you download data from [https://www.inaturalist.org/](https://www.inaturalist.org/) so that we can analyze it?  We want:  date of observation  latitude/longitude of observation  what is being observed (we in fact want to use some sort of tree of life classification, as in [https://a-z-animals.com/reference/animal-classification/](https://a-z-animals.com/reference/animal-classification/))  This problem is admittedly still in its infancy.  The immediate win for you would be learning to poke around datasets.  An intermediate win would be visualization and understanding some new tools.  If things work out, I think that this could be an unexpectedly novel combination of tools applied to an interesting problem.
